## T-Bank Laravel v1.0.0

This is the backend logic for the T-Bank app which is to be made public soon.

It consists of three models:

1. **Accounts:** - This contains the customer table fields
2. **Transactions** - This contains the transactions table fields
3. **Savings** - This contains the user's yearly savings table fields

It also has three controllers:

1. **AccountController** - This contains the user account controlling logic like updates, password changes etc
2. **LoginController** - As the name suggests, it's for handling the user's login processing. Most security filtering(regex, validations are done on the app's side)
3. **StatementsView** - This is for processing the user's statement requests
4. **SavingsController** - It processes the user's savings.

All the routes are stored in the **web.php** file.

> This was purely the backend. No **view** file was created. The UI is rendered using the android app(To be released soon).

> Also note this is the first version, so more features will be added later. You can openly contribute to this, customise it for your use etc.
